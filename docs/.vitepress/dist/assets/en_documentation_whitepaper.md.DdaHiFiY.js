Assessment System and Methodology&quot;">​</a></h2><p>AgentPsy has established a complete psychological assessment system that supports multiple standardized psychological assessment scales. The system currently supports 14 different assessment types, including Big Five personality tests, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, Motivation tests, Graph Mapping tests, Citizenship tests, Customer Service tests, Nerd Cognitive Style tests, and Narcissistic Tendency tests. Each assessment scale is designed based on corresponding psychological theoretical frameworks and provides detailed scoring criteria and analysis methods.</p><p>In terms of assessment methodology, AgentPsy adopts scenario-based assessment. Each assessment question includes a specific scenario description and instructions to the agent, requiring the agent to respond in a specific context. The assessment process analyzes and scores the agent&#39;s responses through an independent evaluation LLM, ensuring the objectivity and accuracy of the assessment. The system supports the injection of various stress factors, including level 0-4 emotional stress, four types of cognitive traps (paradox, circularity, semantic fallacy, procedural), and configurable context load, thus comprehensively evaluating the agent&#39;s performance under different stress environments.</p><p>The analysis of assessment results is based on a multi-dimensional scoring system. For Big Five personality tests, the system calculates the average scores of each dimension and maps them to MBTI types; for DASS tests, it calculates the scores of three dimensions: depression, anxiety, and stress; for motivation tests, it evaluates the strength of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. All assessment results will generate detailed analysis reports, providing users with comprehensive assessment information.</p><h2 id="_4-application-scenarios-and-advantages-analysis" tabindex="-1">4.
